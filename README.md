📚 Python & SQL Practice

🚀 Overview

This repository is dedicated to practicing **Python** and **SQL (SQLite)** in **VS Code**, based on exercises and examples from the **HarvardX CS50 courses** on edX : 

**CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python**
  
**CS50SQL – Introduction to Databases with SQL**

As an **auditor** of these courses, I have recreated and adapted key concepts, exercises, and challenges for self-improvement and reference while ensuring confidence and honesty in the process. Out of respect for the HarvardX instructors and their work, I have modified the content rather than duplicating it directly, staying true to the principles of academic integrity.

This repository also contains adapted exercises and projects completed as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. It includes Python scripts, SQL queries, and Jupyter Notebooks covering various data analysis and data science concepts.

📂 Contents

🐍 **Python Practice:** Covers loops, functions, file handling, and scripting, API, webscraping.
🗄️ **SQL Practice:** Includes database design, queries, joins, and advanced SQL techniques.
🛠  **Hands-on Exercises:** Independent coding challenges to reinforce learning.

🔧 Technologies and Tools

**Python 3** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup) 

**SQLite**

**VS Code** 

**Jupyter Notebook** (ipython-sql, SQL Magic)
